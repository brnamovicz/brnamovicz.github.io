### Projects

- [LiDAR Visualization Tool](https://github.com/nicorev/LVT):
A tool to convert to visualize data for self-driving car researchers. This tool enables researchers to visually evaluate the machine learning models that power self-driving cars. I was on the 7-person team that built this as a semester long class project.

- PG Case Scraper:
I built a scraper for Court Watch PG that automatically collects data from the Maryland Case Search Database. The scraper then processes that data and adds it to a database maintained by Court Watch. This increased the amount and variety of data Court Watch can collect while significantly reducing collection time and error. This code is not publicly available for privacy reasons.

- [Are Upsets More Likely Between Division Rivals in the NFL?](https://brnamovicz.github.io/NFL-Upsets/):
This project aims to determine whether NFL games played by teams in the same division are more likely to end in upsets. I don't find any clear relationship between division status and upsets.

- [A Statistical Refutation of Steve Cortes](https://brnamovicz.github.io/Election/):
In this project I respond to an article that alleges statistical evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 election. I find that the argument made in the article lacks statistical merit.

- [Analysis of Baltimore Crime Data](https://github.com/brnamovicz/Baltimore):
This is a quick tutorial for mapping crime data in baltimore. Due to the file size, you have to download a zip file to view this.
